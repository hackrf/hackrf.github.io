作者在WIKI上<a href="https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/wiki/Jawbreaker#set-your-jawbreaker-free">写道</a>：
<blockquote>Jawbreaker has an SMA antenna connector but also includes a built-in PCB antenna intended for operation near 900 MHz. It isn't a very good antenna. Seriously. A paperclip stuck into the SMA connector would probably be better.</blockquote>
